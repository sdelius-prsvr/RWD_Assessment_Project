**Project brief**

You've been hired to build a homepage for an imaginary community college. The college has stipulated that the would like a page that has a three column layout with 50% of the width devoted to summaries and elevator pitches, 25% for the 10 top course choices(with an option to see more), and the right 25% of the page should be a navigation bar.

Note: You may use the goal.png picture supplied for ideas or structure, but you only need what is on the rubric so try to make it your own!

**Fonts:**

First of all, download a couple of free-to-use fonts. Because this is a college, the fonts should be chosen to give the page a fairly serious, formal, trustworthy feel: a serif site-wide font for the general body text, coupled with a sans-serif or slab serif for the headings might be nice.

Use a suitable service to generate bulletproof @font-face code for these two fonts.
Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your headings.

You will need to use either flexbox or grid appropriately somewhere in your home page. Because making thing look even is a significant part of web design, fulfilling this requirement should be easy. 

**Github**
You will be making a github repository and making quality commits and messages throughout your project. You should be regularly committing after completing sections or elements in your project.

After your project is finished, push your repo up and deploy it on github pages. Attach both the repository link and the github pages link to the assignment in Google class room. 


**General text styling:**

Give the page a site-wide font-size of 10px.

Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined using a suitable relative unit.

Give your body text a suitable line-height.

Center your top level heading on the page.

Give your headings a little bit of letter-spacing to make them not too squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.

Give your body text some letter-spacing and word-spacing, as appropriate.


**Links:**

Give the link focus and hover states some alternate css that go with the color of the horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.

Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them the underline disappears.

Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.

Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out nicely, but make it still fit in with the overall page design.

Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next to them.


**Lists:**

Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall page. Each list item should have the same line-height as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.

Give your list items a nice bullet appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.


**Navigation menu:**

Style your navigation menu so that it harmonizes with the page.

**Footer**
Don't forget to add an appropriate footer to the bottom of the page.


**Hints and tips**

You don't necessarily have to make the nav menu look like buttons, but it needs to be a bit taller so that it doesn't look silly on the side of the page; also remember that you need to make this one a vertical nav menu.

**Stretch**

If this was too easy for you, try adding a media query or two to change up how the website flows.
