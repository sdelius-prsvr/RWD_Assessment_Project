This is a responsive web design assessment project.  The assignment is to create a webpage for an imaginary college, per a set of provided guidelines.  I have pursued an aesthetic which may not be of interest to most colleges, but which I imagine the adminsitration and faculty of Universidad Iquisici√≥n would appreciate.  It is always important to provide for the needs and interests of the client, and to anticipate those which they may not explicitly articulate.  Though I eschewed the stone archway looking out onto a lovely little torture scene as a compromise between the sensibilities of the good Cardinals and those of my instructors.  Perhaps after their assessment, I will more freely pursue this avenue of expression.
